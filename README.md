## 🔥 Why Zantaku Exists

Yes, other apps exist. But they force you into two broken choices:

- Pay a monopoly for limited content, region locks, and a very limited support system  
- Or dive into the chaotic world of piracy — installing shady apps, managing adblockers, finding sketchy extensions, and constantly hoping nothing breaks or infects your device

That whole scene? It's a mess.  
**Zantaku ends that.**

> “I created this app because I wanted my own platform where I can watch and read freely. No other apps let me do this.”  
> — **Ayodaza**, Founder of Zantaku

Zantaku combines everything into one clean platform — anime, manga, light novels — all in one place.  

No hacks. No extensions. No paywalls. No more worries. Focus on what you loved to do. Everything is yours now.
