# Video Segment Download Progress Feature

This document describes the implementation of the video segment download progress indicator in the Kamilist app.

## Overview

The download progress feature shows users a real-time indicator of how many video segments have been downloaded and cached for smoother playback. This improves the user experience by providing visual feedback during buffering.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Progress Tracking in `api/proxy/nativeProxy.ts`

The native proxy module now tracks download progress with the following enhancements:

- Added a `DownloadProgress` type to structure progress data
- Implemented a publish/subscribe pattern with `subscribeToDownloadProgress()`
- Modified the segment download functions to update progress in real-time
- Enhanced logging for better debugging

Progress tracking includes:
- Number of total segments to download
- Number of completed segment downloads
- Number of segments currently being downloaded
- Overall percentage completion

### 2. Progress UI Component in `app/components/DownloadProgress.tsx`

A new React component that:
- Displays a visual progress bar
- Shows percentage completion
- Displays the number of segments downloaded vs. total
- Auto-hides when download is complete
- Uses smooth animations for progress updates

### 3. Integration in Player

The component is integrated into the video player UI and:
- Only appears when segment downloads are in progress
- Automatically hides when downloads are complete
- Positioned to be visible but not intrusive
- Works in both portrait and landscape orientations

## Usage

The progress indicator will automatically appear when video segments are being downloaded. No additional configuration is needed.

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements for future versions:
- Add ability to pause/resume prefetching of segments
- Allow users to manually toggle the visibility of the progress indicator
- Provide more detailed network statistics for debugging
- Add estimated time remaining for segment downloads

## Technical Notes

- The progress tracking uses React hooks and a publish/subscribe pattern
- Animations are handled using React Native's Animated API
- Download progress updates are batched to avoid excessive UI updates
- The component handles component unmounting correctly to prevent memory leaks
